## Contents

The WordPress Plugin PageSpeed Module includes the following files:

* `.gitignore`. Used to exclude certain files from the repository.
* `CHANGELOG.md`. The list of changes to the core project.
* `README.md`. The file that you’re currently reading.
* A `plugin-name` directory that contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.

## Features

* The PageSpeed Module is based on the [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API), [Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards), and [Documentation Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).
* All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to be changed.
* The PageSpeed Module uses a strict file organization scheme that correspond both to the WordPress Plugin Repository structure, and that make it easy to organize the files that compose the plugin.
* The project includes a `.pot` file as a starting point for internationalization.

## Installation

The PageSpeed Module can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is".

## WordPress.org Preparation

The original launch of this version of the PageSpeed Module included the folder structure needed for using your plugin on the WordPress.org. That folder structure has been moved to its own repo here: https://github.com/kagg/

## Recommended Tools

### i18n Tools

The WordPress Plugin PageSpeed Module uses a variable to store the text domain used when internationalizing strings throughout the PageSpeed Module. To take advantage of this method, there are tools that are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:

* [Poedit](https://poedit.net/)
* [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)
* [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)

Any of the above tools should provide you with the proper tooling to internationalize the plugin.
